// Today we will learn how to use if statements.
// These are a building blocks of programming.
// They allow us to fork our code and make decisions based on the data we have.
// Boolean (True/False) expressions are the fundamental building blocks of if statements.
// Boolean statments can be easy to understand, but can also be very complex.
// Over time you will learn how to write more complex boolean statements.

// Example
// Guess the number
function partOneA () {
